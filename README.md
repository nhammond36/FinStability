Abstract
Interest rate changes or net bond sales purchases, fiscal insurance in ample reserves regime.
A state-contingent debt policy, unexpectedly buying or selling long-term debt, can offset surplus shocks and stabilize inflation – though at the cost of future expected inflation

Can active or state contingent debt policy, unexpectedly buying or selling long term debt, offset surplus shocks and stabilize inflation? The central bank can offset the inflationary effect of a fiscal shock by raising interest rates but the interest rate rise must be persistent and unexpected. Conversely, lowering the interest rate would offset unexpected deflation (or growth?). In this era of ample reserves, the IORB is the policy rate, the Federal Funds rate is the target. Since changes in the real interest rate act as a fiscal shock, changes in the discount rate (or administered rates IORB and o/n reverse repo rate (RRP) can also  offset fiscal shocks to restore the present value relation .  
 
Net bond purchases by the Federal Reserve can offset government budget surplus shocks. Unexpectedly selling or buying long term debt offsets current surplus shocks but at the cost of higher future inflation or deflation. This paper proposes an active or state-contingent debt policy, unexpectedly buying or selling long term debt designed to offset surplus shocks, can stabilize inflation.
